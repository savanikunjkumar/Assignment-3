Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
🔹 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Defines a function named factorial.

Takes a number as an argument.

Calculates the factorial using a loop.

Returns the calculated factorial.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

🔹 Explanation

The program defines a function that multiplies numbers from 1 to the given number to calculate the factorial. The function is then called with a sample value, and the output is displayed.

🔹 Sample Output
Factorial of 5 is: 120

 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
🔹 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Takes a number as input from the user.

Uses the math module to calculate:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine of the number (in radians)

Displays all calculated results.

🔹 Explanation

The program uses Python’s built-in math module to perform mathematical calculations. User input is taken, and different math functions are applied to it. The results are then printed clearly.

🔹 Sample Output
Enter a number: 4
Square root of the number: 2.0
Natural logarithm (log base e): 1.3862943611198906
Sine of the number (in radians): -0.7568024953079282
